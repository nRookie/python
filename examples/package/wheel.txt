What are wheels?

Wheels are the new standard of Python distribution and are intended to 
replace eggs. Support is offered in pip >= 1.4 and setuptools >= 0.8

Advantages of wheels 

1. Faster installation for pure Python and native C extension packages.
2. Avoids arbitrary code execution for installation. (Avoids setup.py)
3. installation of a C extension does not require a compiler on Linux Windows or 
macOS.
4. Allows better caching for testing and continuous integration.
5. Creates .pyc files as part of installation to ensure they match the Python
interpreter used.
6. More consistent installs across platforms and machines.
