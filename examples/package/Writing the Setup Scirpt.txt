The data_files option can be used to specify additional
files needed by the module distribution: configuration files,
message catalogs, data files, anything which doesn't fit in the previous 
categories.

data_files specifies a sequence of (directory,files) pairs in the 
following way:


Each(directory,files) pair in the sequence specifies the 
installation directory and the files to install there.


Each file name in files is interpreted relative to the setup.py
script at the top of the package source distribution. Note that 
you can specify the directory where the data files will be installed,
but you cannot rename the data files themselves.

The directory should be a relative path. It is interpreted 
relative to the installation prefix(Python's sys.prefix for system
installations; site.USER_BASE for user installations). Distutils
